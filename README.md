<h1>Project 2: Members Only!</h1>

<h4>This is a rails project from <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication">The Odin Project</a></h4>

<p>In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.</p>

<p>This will be a chance for you to "roll your own" authentication system, very similar to how you did in the tutorial. As usual, we will be focusing on data and function, not style. If you want to add your own stylistic flourishes, consider it extra credit.</p>
